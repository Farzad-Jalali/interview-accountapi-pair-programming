# ðŸš€ Welcome to the Form3 Pair Programming Interview ðŸš€

## Instructions

This exercise has been designed to be completed in 1 hours. The goal of this exercise is to write a client library 
in Go to access our fake [account API](http://api-docs.form3.tech/api.html#organisation-accounts) service running on `http://localhost:8080`. 

### Should
- Client library should be written in Go
- Implement `Fetch` as [documented](http://api-docs.form3.tech/api.html#organisation-accounts)
- Focus on writing full-stack tests that cover the full range of expected and unexpected use-cases
 - Tests can be written in Go idomatic style or in BDD style. Make sure tests are easy to read
 
 
### Notes
- `account` model structs have been created for you in `pkg/accountapi/account.go`

#### List accounts

`$ curl localhost:8080/v1/organisation/accounts`

#### Add an account

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/v1/organisation/accounts -d '{
         "data": {
           "type": "accounts",
           "id": "ad27e265-9605-4b4b-a0e5-3003ea9cc4dc",
