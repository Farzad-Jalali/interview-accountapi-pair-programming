# ðŸš€ Welcome to the Form3 Pair Programming Interview ðŸš€

## Instructions

This exercise has been designed to be completed in 1 hours. The goal of this exercise is to write a client library 
in Go to access our fake [account API](http://api-docs.form3.tech/api.html#organisation-accounts) service running on `http://localhost:8080`. 

### Should
- Client library should be written in Go
- Implement `Fetch` as [documented](http://api-docs.form3.tech/api.html#organisation-accounts)
- Focus on writing full-stack tests that cover the full range of expected and unexpected use-cases
 - Tests can be written in Go idomatic style or in BDD style. Make sure tests are easy to read
 
 
### Notes
- `account` model structs have been created for you in `pkg/accountapi/account.go`
